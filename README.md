# AnnotateMe
This Android-based application enables Annotators to label the dataset by two major techniques, Simple image classification, and Bounding box. The Simple classification works with one class having one label, whereas, in the Bounding box, we can bind multiple objects in an image within a single frame. After creating the project, Annotators or users can share and work on the same project with others using the functionalities of a private repository. Annotators can also work on projects by downloading datasets from the public repository. They can also export the project files with various file formats.
<br>
AnnotateMe is a mobile-based Data Annotation and Image Labeling Tool for ML and DL model. This mobile-based annotation tool is a software application designed for mobile devices that allows users to annotate and label on various types of image contents. With this tool, users can easily add comments, highlights, drawings, and other annotations to images, documents, and videos directly from their mobile devices. One of the key advantages of a mobile-based annotation tool is its convenience and portability. This tool offers several advantages. It provides flexibility and convenience as users can annotate on the go, enabling collaboration and quick decision-making even when they are not at their desks. This allows seamless integration with cloud storage services, facilitating easy storage, sharing, and access to annotated files across devices.<br>
<br>
AnnoatateMe facilitates real-time collaboration by allowing users to make annotations and share them instantly with team members or stakeholders. This immediate feedback loop enhances communication, accelerates decision-making, and streamlines workflows. Team members can provide comments, suggestions, or revisions in real-time, leading to faster iterations and improved project outcomes. Annotation projects are automatically synced, ensuring that users have access to the most up-to-date versions on any Android device (minimum Android version 6). This feature enhances productivity, as users can switch between devices without worrying about data loss or file compatibility issues.<br>
<br>
This tool typically offers intuitive and user-friendly interfaces optimized for mobile devices, making the labeling and annotation process efficient and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. These interfaces make it easy for users to navigate and utilize the annotation features effectively, even for those with limited technical expertise. The streamlined and accessible interface ensures a smooth and efficient annotation process, saving time and effort. Overall, a mobile-based annotation tool enhances productivity, collaboration, and accessibility, making it a valuable asset for individuals and teams working in diverse industries.<br>

Objective <br>
•	The objective of the project is to ease the data labeling process by using a mobile-based application. <br>
•	We also aim to increase the labeling by making it possible to label more samples through the participation of normal users i.e. other than trained annotators. <br>
•	After creating the project, Annotators or users can share and work on the same project with others using the functionalities of a private repository.<br>
•	The proposed project will also enable the collection of more samples as any user with a smartphone can participate and share labeled images on request or voluntarily<br>
